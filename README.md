# Mini Ultra Pro
Mini Ultra Pro is an Arduino Compatible 32-bit ARM Cortex M0+ board that is suitable for ultra low power applications. During deep sleep mode, the board consumes only 16.5 uA (with the on-board serial flash chip and radio module in sleep mode). The board comes equipped with a 2Mbyte of serial flash and E19-900M20S2 LoRa radio module. Suitable application includes ultra low power wireless sensor network nodes that runs on Li-Ion/Pol batteries. On-board charger supports Li-Ion/Pol with proper load sharing capability to prolong the lifespan of the battery. The LoRa capable E19-900M20S2 radio module is able to achieve up to 8 km (in semi urban area, frequency of 915 MHz, transmission power of 20 dBm, LoRa spreading factor (SF) of 12, and coding rate (CR) of 4/5). A unique 64-bit MAC ID chip (Microchip's 24AA025E64) is available on-board to be used as DEVEUI in a LoRaWAN network.
